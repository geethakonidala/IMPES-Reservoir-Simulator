# IMPES-Reservoir-Simulator
This is the source code for 2D Heterogeneous IMPES Reservoir Simulator. Framework for this simulator is designed by solving the pressure equation implicitly and transport equation explicitly. Both these eqations are coupled to produce IMPES solver. This simulator studies the flow and transport of 2-Phase immiscible displacement of hydrocarbons in subsurface reservoirs.

  Scripting is done in MATLAB.
